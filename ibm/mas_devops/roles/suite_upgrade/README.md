suite_upgrade
===============================================================================
This role validates if a given MAS installation is ready for the core platform to be upgraded to a specific subscription channel, and (as long as dry run mode is not enabled) will execute the upgrade.

- It will validate that the current subscription channel is able to be upgraded to the target channel.
- It will validate that all installed applications have already been upgraded to versions compatible with the new version of the Core Platform.
- It will upgrade the MAS core platform to the desired channel (as long as dry run is not enabled).
- It will validate that the core platform has been successfully reconciled at the upgraded version.
- It will **not** validate that all core services successfully deploy after the reconcile (but we will be working on this limitation).

Example Playbook
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Automatic Target Selection
Running this playbook will upgrade MAS to the next release.  If you run this playbook when you are already on the latest release then it will take no action.

```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  any_errors_fatal: true
  vars:
    mas_instance_id: instance1
    mas_upgrade_dryrun: False
  roles:
    - ibm.mas_devops.suite_upgrade_check
```

### Explicit Upgrade Target
Running this playbook will attempt to upgrade MAS to the specified release.  If the specified release cannot be upgraded to from the installed version of MAS then no action will be taken.
```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  any_errors_fatal: true
  vars:
    mas_instance_id: instance1
    mas_channel: 8.8.x
    mas_upgrade_dryrun: False
  roles:
    - ibm.mas_devops.suite_upgrade_check
```
